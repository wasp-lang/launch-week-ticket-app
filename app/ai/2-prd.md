# Wasp Launch Week Ticket App â€“ PRD (Minimal Vertical Slice)

## Overview & Goals
Build a simple, visually appealing web app for Wasp Launch Week #10 that allows users to log in with GitHub and generate a unique, shareable ticket featuring their name and a mascot image. The app should leverage Wasp's full-stack features, especially Auth, and be implemented using a vertical slice approach for rapid iteration.

## User Flows
1. **Landing Page (Logged Out):**
   - Users see a Launch Week #10 announcement and a prominent CTA to log in with GitHub.
2. **Auth:**
   - Users log in via GitHub (using Wasp's built-in Auth).
3. **Ticket Generation (Logged In):**
   - After login, users see a "Generate my ticket" button.
   - On click, a ticket is generated with:
     - User's name (from GitHub)
     - Unique ticket number (sequential or random, unique per user)
     - Wasp mascot (Da Boi) performing a randomly chosen action, generated by AI (fallback to static image if needed)
   - The ticket is displayed to the user.
   - (Optional, preferred) User can download or share their ticket.

## Features (MVP Scope)
- **Landing Page:**
  - Responsive, styled to match existing demo features
  - CTA to log in with GitHub
- **GitHub Auth:**
  - Enable GitHub login via Wasp config
- **Ticket Page:**
  - "Generate my ticket" button
  - Ticket display with user's name, unique number, mascot image
  - Error handling for login/image generation failures
  - (Optional) Download/share button (can be stubbed)
- **Mascot Image Generation:**
  - Call AI image API for Da Boi action (fallback to static image on error)
- **Responsiveness & Accessibility:**
  - All pages/components should be responsive and accessible

## Technical Approach
- Use Wasp's built-in Auth with GitHub provider
- Define new routes/pages in `main.wasp` and implement in `src/`
- Implement ticket generation as a Wasp action (server-side)
- Use React components for UI, styled with Tailwind to match existing app
- Integrate AI image generation API (mock/fallback for first iteration)
- Store no persistent ticket data (image generated on the fly)

## Success Criteria
- Users can log in with GitHub
- Users can generate and view a unique ticket with their name and mascot image
- The app is visually appealing, responsive, and consistent with the rest of the app
- Errors (login, image generation) are handled gracefully

## Out-of-Scope/Next Steps
- Persistent ticket storage
- Advanced sharing features (social, QR code, etc.)
- Analytics, admin dashboard
- More advanced AI image generation or customization
